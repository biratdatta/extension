# Welcome to the Office Random Episode Selector!

This extension was the result of me trying to watch one of the funny Episodes of **the office**
 which you may know as the series that many people love. 
 This extension runs on JavaScript, HTML and CSS, so it is pretty simple to use. 
 

# How to Install

Since I dont have a developer account for now you can just fork this repo, and then  clone and run it on your machine. 
 **simple!**
Then what you have to do is go to chrome://extensions and turn on your developer mode and click on load unpacked and select the folder of the extension and then browser will do it's magic and you can have it on your own machine. 

## This is Open-Source af!

 Since the Office is a big show and I have to sort out a lot of episodes so, what you can do as an open source contribution is you can also contribute to this project.  

## How to Contribute?

Same as forking the file, clone it on your PC and first run it and see if it works. If it works then Go to the popup.js and check the episodes array and in that add the episode ID and the episode name and open for a pull request
